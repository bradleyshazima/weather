🌦️ Liquid Weather — Animated City-Based Weather App
Liquid Weather is a modern, animated weather web app built with Vite + React, featuring smooth transitions, real-time weather data, and dynamic backgrounds of iconic city landmarks.

Users can explore different cities, view local weather conditions, get short advisory tips (like "Carry an umbrella"), and see ambient city descriptions. Each city features a unique background image and custom-designed weather icons — all wrapped in a stylish, scrollable interface with delayed animations for extra polish.
